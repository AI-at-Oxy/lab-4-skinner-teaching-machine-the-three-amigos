Skinner Teaching Machine - Frame Definitions
COMP 395: AI and Learning Technologies

This file contains the instructional frames for your teaching machine.

=============================================================================
YOUR TASK:
=============================================================================
1. Choose a topic you want to teach (5-10 frames minimum)
2. Design your frame structure (see options below)
3. Write frames that follow Skinner's principles:
   - Small steps: Each frame teaches ONE small concept
   - Build sequentially: Later frames build on earlier ones
   - High success rate: Design for ~95% correct answers
   - Clear prompts: Unambiguous fill-in-the-blank or short answer

=============================================================================
FRAME STRUCTURE OPTIONS:
=============================================================================

OPTION A - Minimal:
frame = {
    "prompt": "The capital of France is _____.",
    "answer": "paris"
}

OPTION B - With feedback (RECOMMENDED):
frame = {
    "prompt": "The capital of France is _____.",
    "answer": "paris",
    "feedback_correct": "Correct! Paris is the capital of France.",
    "feedback_incorrect": "Not quite. The answer is Paris."
}

OPTION C - Rich (with hints and multiple answers):
frame = {
    "prompt": "What keyword defines a function in Python?",
    "answer": "def",
    "answers": ["def"],  # List for multiple acceptable answers
    "hint": "It's a 3-letter word.",
    "feedback_correct": "Yes! 'def' is used to define functions.",
    "feedback_incorrect": "Not quite. We use 'def' to define functions.",
    "topic": "python-functions"
}

Choose a structure and be CONSISTENT across all your frames!

        "feedback_incorrect": "Remember, we use = for assignment. So: x = 5"

        "answer": "print",
        "feedback_correct": "Yes! print(x) displays the value of x.",
        "feedback_incorrect": "We use the print() function to display values."

# =============================================================================
# TIPS FOR WRITING GOOD FRAMES:
# =============================================================================
# 
# 1. START EASY: First frames should be very simple
# 
# 2. ONE CONCEPT PER FRAME: Don't combine multiple ideas
# 
# 3. USE BLANKS STRATEGICALLY: 
#    "In Python, we use _____ to define a function."
#    Not: "What do we use to define a function in Python?"
# 
# 4. BUILD ON PREVIOUS FRAMES: Frame 5 can reference concepts from Frame 3
# 
# 5. ANTICIPATE ERRORS: Your feedback_incorrect should address common mistakes
# 
# 6. NORMALIZE ANSWERS: The app converts to lowercase and strips whitespace,
#    but consider if "=" and "equals" should both be accepted
